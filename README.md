# Automated Email using Python
### App Password for Email:
This is needed to provide temporary passcode to authenticate, without providing default credentials. Generate the code with your sender email from "[Google App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)".  This command will make your credentials save in your system env. Provides extra layer of security when dealing with passwords in coding.

```
setx SENDER_EMAIL "your_mail@gmail.com"
setx SENDER_PASSWORD "aaaa bbbb cccc dddd"
```
